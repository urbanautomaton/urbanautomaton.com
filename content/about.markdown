I'm Simon Coffey, a multi-purpose developer/engineer working mostly with
Ruby these days, but with experience in C++, C#, Prolog, and an
assortment of others, including a little bit of Clojure dabbling.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/urbanautomaton), or
wherever it is I happen to be at the time you're looking.
