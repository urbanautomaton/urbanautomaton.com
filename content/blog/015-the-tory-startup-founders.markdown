Ninety-three individuals who claim to have "founded, funded or run some
of Britain’s most successful startups" recently [signed a
letter](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/29/startup-businesses-back-the-conservatives)
backing the Conservative Party in the upcoming election. Writing in a
personal capacity -- yet, strangely, all with their company names
attached -- they say:

> Through the internet we serve your food, find your destination, send
> your money, book a taxi, identify a song you are hearing – and many
> other things besides. Our success has been the product of sleepless
> nights and days of hard work. 

The implicit threat is terrifying enough: under a Labour government we
risk starving to death in our own hallways for want of a takeaway menu,
our last conscious thought on this Earth: "was that... Yeezy?"

But who, you might ask, who *are* they, these noble purveyors of pizza?
I read their Crunchbase profiles so you don't have to. Let's look at
some individuals, then some overall numbers.

## Joanna Shields

A standout name amidst an otherwise nondescript bunch, Ms Shields is
otherwise known as Baroness Shields OBE (Con), erstwhile Chair of Tech
City UK and current Digital Advisor to the Prime Minister.

We have her assurance, however, that she is endorsing the Conservatives
in a purely personal capacity, and must therefore assume that her role
as a sitting Conservative parliamentarian has no bearing on her views.

For those such as myself who take a dimmer view of our unelected upper
house, it's truly heartening to realise that there are peers like
Baroness Shields who can put aside all thoughts of party affiliation,
who can disregard their employment prospects, and place the interests of
the country first.

## Brent Hoberman

AKA "Brenty", "Big Bren", "Brentasaurus", "Monarch of the Bren", "Bren
Gunner" or, if you're not one of his best mates: "Brent Hoberman CBE".

Appointed Commander of our magnificent Empire in 2015 for services to
entrepreneurship, since 2007 he has also been a member of the New
Enterprise Council, an advisory group originally formed by the
Conservative Party to capitalise on business opposition to Gordon
Brown's capital gains tax reforms.

Again, however, we must surely take him at his word that his views are
purely personal, and that his role as advisor to the Conservative Party
or the honours bestowed upon him by said party do not in any way
influence his thoughts on what is best for the country at large.

## Numbers

No-one has the stomach for a rundown of 93 bespoke mailorder dogfood
salespeople, least of all me, so let's move on to some aggregate
figures. Of the startup tories:

* 1 in 3 is a banker, former banker or venture capitalist
* At least 5 have been granted honours or peerages in the last Parliament
* 2 have recently left their companies to shareholder jubilation
* Around half have self-written Wikipedia entries
* 57 have Obvious Tory Faces
* One is literally wearing a fedora on his LinkedIn profile:

* 9 have *really* Obvious Tory Faces
* One wishes he was The Rock:

Of the startups:

* 18 are not startups
* 62 are bullshit
* 6 are *total* bullshit
* 1 is literally the worst idea anyone has ever had

This leaves 13 that might not be completely awful.
