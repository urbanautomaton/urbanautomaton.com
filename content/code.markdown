### Eliza

The main page of this website hosts a Javascript clone of
[ELIZA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), an early NLP project by
Joseph Weizenbaum, and one of the first chatterbots ever written. The
source code is [on Github](https://github.com/urbanautomaton/eliza-js)
for your perusal, enjoyment and/or horror. The script (which is where
the majority of the "intelligence" lives) is mostly faithful to the
original.

### Birds / Boids

I'm working on a bird flocking simulation - so far I've got to the stage
of a 2D javascript version of [boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/).
I've written about this [here](/blog/2017/01/29/passable-2d-birds/), and
the code is [here](https://github.com/urbanautomaton/boids).

### env_hooker

I've
[released](/blog/2017/01/05/envhooker-a-tiny-shell-environment-switcher/)
a shell environment switcher called
[`env_hooker`](http://github.com/urbanautomaton/env_hooker). It's an
(ugh) lightweight and (aaaaargh) minimal alternative to things like
[direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), that I definitely did not
write just because I didn't know about those other things.

### Misc

The rest of my publicly available code can also be found [on
Github](https://github.com/urbanautomaton). My dotfiles are really good,
no honestly they are. You can tell because I actually released some of
them (see above).
