title: Code

The main page of this website hosts a Javascript clone of
[ELIZA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), an early NLP project by
Joseph Weizenbaum, and one of the first chatterbots ever written. The
source code is [on Github](https://github.com/urbanautomaton/eliza-js)
for your perusal, enjoyment and/or horror. The script (which is where
the majority of the "intelligence" lives) is mostly faithful to the
original.

The rest of my publicly available code can also be found [on
Github](https://github.com/urbanautomaton). My dotfiles are really
good, no honestly they are.
